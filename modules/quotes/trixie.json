    "Was there ever any doubt?",
    "Watch in awe as Trixies performs the most amazing feat for magic every witnessed by pony eyes!",
    "Well, well, well. It seems we have some \"neigh-sayers\" in the audience.",

    "Witness, my subjects, graze upon an even greater and powerfuler Trixie!",
    "Don't you think the Great and Apologetic Trixie is the most magnificent humble pony you have ever seen?",
    "Huh. You may have vanquished an Ursa Minor, but you will never have the amazing, show-stopping ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie!",
    "Well, well, well. It seems we have some neigh-sayers in the audience. Who is so ignorant as to challenge the magical ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie? Do they not know that they're in the presence of the most magical unicorn in all of Equestria?"
