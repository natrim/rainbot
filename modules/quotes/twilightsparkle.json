	"All the ponies in this town are CRAZY!",
	"Um, not very likely.",
	"Rainbow must be angry with Applejack. She must hate her guts. Ohh ... how wonderful!",
	"Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my ... OW!",
	"Yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes!",
	"Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.",
	"Please don't hate me.",
	"Pardon me, Princess.",
	"You told me it was all an old pony tale.",
	"Look out, here comes Tom!",
	"It's the perfect plan.",
	"We will do everything by the book!",
	"Scarf? Check. Saddle? Check. Boots? Check. ‘Spike refusing to get up and go back to sleep’? Check. It's a good thing I'm so organised. I'm ready!",
	"Ooh! Doesn't that hurt?",
	"Are you crazy?",
	"I uh, I think I hear my laundry calling! Sorry, gotta go.",
	"She only has one cat.",
	"I never thought it would happen. My friends ... have turned into complete JERKS!",
	"If you can't catch her, Discord wins!",
	"Get back! All of you! This is my book. And I'm going to READ IT!",
	"Pinkie Pie, you're a genius!",
	"I'm going to do what I do best: lecture her!",
	"Pinkie Pie, aren't you a little old for this?",
	"You ruined my horn!!",
	"Necklace. Necklace. Necklace. Necklace. AND... BIG Crown thingy!",
	"Alright Applejack. Your applebucking hasn’t just caused you problems, its overpropelled pegasus, practically poisoned plenty of ponies, and terrorized bushels of brand new bouncing baby bunnies.",
	"If I can't find a problem I am going to have to make one.",
	"Yeah, great news. That I just got from a wedding invitation! Not from my brother, but from a piece of paper! Thanks a lot, Shining Armor. I mean, really, he couldn't tell me personally? [sarcastically, using a sandwich as a puppet] Hey, Twilight, just thought you should know I'm making a really big decision that changes everything. Oh, nevermind, you'll hear about it when you get the invitation.",
	"Why are you all looking at me like that?",
	"I just can't seem to get these new wings to do what I want them to do when I want them to do it.",
	"My new role in Equestria may mean I have to take on new responsibilities, and our friendships may be tested, but it will never, ever be broken.",
	"Q: You realize this is information we could have used hours ago?!\nA: And rob you of a valuable lesson about being princess? What kind of friend do you think I am?",
	"What in the world is that?!",
	"No one likes sarcasm, Spike.",
	"A.K. Yearling and Daring Do are one and the same! My mind is officially blown!",
	"That's not a plan!",
	"So much for \"element of surprise\".",
	"You know, choosing not to choose isn't really a decision.",
	"[eats noisily] [mouthful] I didn't realize how hungry I was. I'm so glad you asked me to join you here to today. [swallows food]",
	"Pinkie, stop rapping! That isn't gonna help Rainbow!",
	"I'm sure none of the other ponies will even notice I'm here.",
	"Never, ever, ever, ever take another book out of the library at the castle without asking! Princess Cadance and Princess Luna have much better things to do than help me clean up Ponyville! Do you have any idea how hard it was to reverse that much dark magic?!",
	"Equestria, we have a problem.",
	"I must have caught a particularly strong breeze...or something."
