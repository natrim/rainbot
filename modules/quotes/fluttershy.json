	"I'm confused...",
	"Oh, I like a nice picnic party.",
	"Oh... You... um... you didn't hear me... um...",
	"I have... stage fright.",
	"I'll get there someday. But for now... baby steps, everypony. Baby steps.",
	"I'm working on a bee-type dance and was hoping you could help me? Does this bring to mind any images for you? Perhaps a bee?",
